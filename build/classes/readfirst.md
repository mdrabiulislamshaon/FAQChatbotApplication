# Simple FAQ Chatbot Application

This Java code implements a simple FAQ chatbot application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Swing. It allows users to input questions, and the chatbot provides predefined responses based on patterns matching user queries.

## Description

The application consists of the following components:

- **GUI Components**: 
  - `JPanel`, `JTextArea` for dialog, and another `JTextArea` for user input.
  - `JScrollPane` for scrolling the dialog.

- **Chat Bot Responses**: 
  - Responses are stored in a 2D array named `chatBot`, where each row contains pairs of user queries and corresponding bot responses.

- **Event Handling**: 
  - Keyboard events (`keyPressed`, `keyReleased`, and `keyTyped` methods) handle user input.

- **Response Generation**: 
  - User input is compared with predefined queries in the `chatBot` array to generate responses.

- **Utility Methods**: 
  - `addText`: Adds text to the dialog.
  - `inArray`: Checks if a string is in an array.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `SimpleFAQChatbotApplication.java` file.
3. Enter questions in the input field and press Enter to get responses from the chatbot.

## Improvements

- Modularize the code into smaller methods for better readability and maintenance.
- Implement error handling for unexpected user input or system errors.
- Explore natural language processing techniques for smarter responses.
- Enhance the graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.
